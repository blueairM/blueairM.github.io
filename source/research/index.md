# Research

My research interests are stochastic process, multivariate statistical analysis, enumerative combinatorics and other scientific problems related to them. More specifically, my interests include only merely

- Time change and transformation of probability measures
- Special functions and multivariate distributions
- Infinite cardinal arithmetics and computational complexity 
- Countably normed rings and pure states in unbounded operators  
- .  .  .
