# NWU Set Theory Seminar(From 2024 January)



Hello~ Welcome to the Set Theory Seminar at Northwest Univeristy!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This is a regularly held up seminar organized by graduates from 2014, Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, Northwest University. We invite you to join us for discussions, presentations, and auditions.

For subscription, please send an email including your resume to any organizer below. For instance, you can send it to one of the organizer [wanghm37@mail2.sysu.edu.cn](wanghm37@mail2.sysu.edu.cn). Once we have reviewed your resume, we will send you an email one day before, containing the title, abstract, and Tencent Meeting link for the upcoming event.

Our discussions typically take place on Fridays, once every one to two weeks. The inaugural session is scheduled for February 2, 2024, from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m (Beijing Time). You can find updated information on titles and abstracts on [Seminar](https://blueairm.github.io/seminar/).

If you have any question or need help, feel free to ask!

**The rigidity of eigenfunctions's gradient estimates**

On compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and smooth (possibly empty), convex (or mean convex) boundary, if the sharp Li-Yau type gradient estimate of an Neumann (or Dirichlet) eigenfunction holds at some non-critical points of the eigenfunction; we show that the manifold is isometric to the product of one lower dimension manifold and a round circle (or a line segment).

Yilong Zhang (Bonn University)

**Green points in the reals**

We construct an expansion of a real closed field by a multiplicative subgroup adapting Poizat's theory of green points Its theory is strongly dependent, and every open set definable in a model of this theory is semialgebraic. We prove that the real field with a dense family of logarithmic spirals, proposed by Zilber, satisfies our theory.
