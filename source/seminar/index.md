# NWU Set Theory Seminar(2024/01/30)



Hello~ Welcome to the Set Theory Seminar at Northwest Univeristy!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This is a regularly held up seminar organized by graduates from 2014, Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, Northwest University. We invite you to join us for discussions, presentations, and auditions.

For subscription, please send an email including your resume to any organizer below. For instance, you can send it to one of the organizer [wanghm37@mail2.sysu.edu.cn](wanghm37@mail2.sysu.edu.cn). Once we have reviewed your resume, we will send you an email one day before, containing the title, abstract, and Tencent Meeting link for the upcoming event.

Our discussions typically take place on Fridays, once every one to two weeks. The inaugural session is scheduled for February 2, 2024, from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m (Beijing Time). You can find updated information on titles and abstracts on [Seminar](https://blueairm.github.io/seminar/).

If you have any question or need help, feel free to ask!

**Hierarchy of Maximal ideals in the Banach Algebra I**

This paper introduces two topologies, namely the weak\*-topology (also known as the product topology) and the Zariski topology on the set of maximal ideals in the Banach algebra using both analytical and algebraic methods. It proves that under the condition of separability, the set of maximal ideals endowed with the weak\*-topology is second countable and metrizable, and it demonstrates that the two topologies are homeomorphic. We illustrate examples such as the continuous function ring $C(X)$, where $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and the $l^p$ space for $1 \leq p < +\infty$.
