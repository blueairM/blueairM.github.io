We list some open problems in C$^{*}$-algebra:

## Question 1 (Naimark's Problem):  
Every C$^{*}$-algebra that has only one irreducible $*$-representation up to unitary equivalence is isomorphic to the $*$-algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space.

Whether Naimark problem is  independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$?

Akemann & Weaver (2004)[^1] used the $\diamondsuit$-Principle to construct a C$^{*}$-algebra with $\aleph _{1}$ generators that serves as a counterexample to Naimark's Problem. But in general its consistency remains unknown.

## Question 2:  


Every C$^{*}$-algebras of density of continuum $\aleph_{1} = 2^{\aleph_{0}}$ has no nonseparable commutative subalgebra.[^2]

Akemann & Donner (1979) constructs example with a C$^{*}$-algebra with $\aleph _{1}$ generators with only separable abelian C$^{*}$-subalgebras. Bice and Koszmider (2017)[^3] remove their assumption of the continuum hypothesis. Whether

## Question 3:  

Every amenable operator algebra is isomorphic to a (necessarily nuclear) C$^{*}$-algebra.


Resolved. Choi, Farah, & Ozawa (2013) [^4] construct a counterexample to this problem in non-separable case, whereas separable case remains open.

## Question 4:  

Do there exist non-discrete second countable locally compact groups which are C$^{*}$-simple?[^5]
